* **[Registration Site](https://aclweb.org/conference/virtual-emnlp-2020-conference-registration/)**

The EMNLP 2020 registration fees are drastically reduced, reflecting our
move to being 100% virtual. We are offering Early rates through October
30th and Late rates beginning October 31st. We include early and late
rates to encourage early registrations so we can approximate the numbers
of users and be able to work around any potential for system crashes or
other glitches due to unexpected high volume. The fees charged will
allow full access to all parts of the conference.

## Registration Details

**Early registration** ends October 30 2020, 11:59 PM (EDT) with Regular
at \$150 and Student at \$50.

**Late registration** begins October 31, 2020 and remains open
throughout the conference, with Regular at \$200 and Student at \$75

## ACL Membership

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a
current (CY 2020) ACL member. So, in addition to the above registration
fee, each Regular will add \$100 membership fee to their registration
and each Student will add \$50 membership fee to their registration if
not already a 2020 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire
calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting
CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL
Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in
the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles
you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts
on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and
related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the
community.

_**This year, the election of ACL Executive Committee is held from Oct.
1 to Oct. 31. One can vote in the election if she/he becomes an ACL
member before Oct. 15**_
