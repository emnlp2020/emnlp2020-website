    We are creating a new sister publication, “Findings of ACL: EMNLP 2020” (hereafter Findings), which will serve as an online journal for papers that are not accepted for publication in the main conference, but nonetheless have been assessed by the programme committee as solid work with sufficient substance, quality and novelty to warrant publication.

An innovation for EMNLP 2020 is a new acceptance category, which will allow for more high quality papers (short and long) to be accepted than we can accomodate in the conference itself. We are creating a new sister publication, “_Findings of ACL: EMNLP 2020_” (hereafter _Findings_), which will serve as an online journal for papers that are not accepted for publication in the main conference, but nonetheless have been assessed by the programme committee as solid work with sufficient substance, quality and novelty to warrant publication. 

These papers will be invited to be published with the stamp of peer review in a new _Findings_ online journal, which will be indexed as part of the ACL anthology. 

Papers appearing in _Findings_ will follow the same timetable as for papers accepted into the EMNLP 2020 conference proceedings. That is, they will have the same camera ready deadline, and be available online by the time of the conference. These papers differ from papers accepted to the EMNLP conference in that _Findings_ papers will not be given a presentation slot at the conference (neither talk or poster). Instead _Findings_ should be considered as a form of online open access journal: papers appearing in _Findings_ will count as full publications, and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences or journals. Long and short papers will be distinguished in separate sections of _Findings_. 

## What kinds of papers will be accepted to _Findings_? 

In addition to the existing review criteria of novelty, rigour, experimental soundness and so forth, reviewers will be asked to assess papers for “publishability” as an additional field in the review form. Reviewers (and chairs) will be asked whether the paper is of a suitable standard to be publishable in its current form, possibly with minor revisions based on reviewer feedback.

The idea here is to separate the paper ranking process that is used to select papers to accept for the main conference, from the classification of whether a paper has sufficient substance, quality and novelty to warrant publication. It is based on the assumption that there are significant numbers of rejected papers that are of a publishable standard, but for various reasons, could not be  accepted into the conference.

Beyond simply ranking, certain kinds of papers are more appropriate for appearing in _Findings_, for instance:

* Papers that make a specific contribution to a narrow subfield, and while not of widespread interest, will have an impact on a small community;
* Papers that extend the state of the art on a particular focused task, but have few novel insights or _Findings_ of broader applicability to the wider EMNLP community;
* Papers that have well-executed, novel experiments and present thorough analyses and _Findings_, but using methods that are not thought to be sufficiently “novel”; and
* Papers that don’t quite fit in EMNLP, but make contributions that are potentially of interest to specific sub-communities.

One common requirement is that the reviewers must agree that the paper is well written, makes an original contribution, has sound methodology, and includes appropriate analysis and conclusions. What sets _Findings_ apart from the main conference papers is that there is no requirement for high perceived impact, and accordingly solid work in untrendy areas and other more niche works will be eligible. These requirements are based on the [criteria for publication at PLoS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information#loc-criteria-for-publication), which you can read about in more detail.

## Why might you want your paper to appear in _Findings_?

Those with papers accepted to _Findings_ will have the option of having the work accepted largely as-is, and being made available online promptly. This will be an attractive option for work that is particularly time-critical, e.g., the novelty of the work would be diminished if publication were delayed by being rejected from EMNLP. This will also help for papers caught by overlapping anonymity periods between conferences, which can preclude public release for a long period. In this case, _Findings_ can offer the option of a quick publication. Note that authors whose papers are accepted for publication in _Findings_ can, of course, opt out, by withdrawing or simply not submitting a camera-ready copy of the paper.

Many papers languish on arXiv without ever being published in a peer-reviewed venue because they were overtaken by the accelerating pace of NLP research. This new publication option will give more authors the chance to publish papers that are good and decent contributions at a given point in time, even if their long-term impact may be modest. This will also reduce the amount of unreviewed work in our field, and thereby increase quality.

## Is this a one-off event?

Should this new avenue for publication be warmly received by the EMNLP community, with sufficient uptake, we anticipate that _Findings_ will continue to operate alongside future iterations of EMNLP, and potentially other conferences in the ACL stable. Any future iterations would appear as different volumes of the _Findings_ electronic journal. 

We hope that having a paper appearing in _Findings_ will be a mark of pride, and provide an important new avenue to have your work published in a timely manner.
