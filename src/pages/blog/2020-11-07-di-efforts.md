Diversity and inclusion initiatives at ACL sponsored conferences are
relatively new. There was a formal diversity and inclusion committee at
ACL 2020. An original focus was to make sure that disabled and minority
participants would be provided for and comfortable at the conference.
This continues, but obviously looks a bit different while the pandemic
has made the conferences virtual. We still need good captioning for
everyone and resources for people who cannot use text easily. A new
concern is that while people are no longer traveling to the conference,
they may need to structure their virtual conference attendance around
domestic obligations, such as childcare.

We have also taken on the responsibility for organizing mentoring at the
conference. The idea is that people with less experience of the
computational linguistics world can get advice from community members
with more experience. Potentially this is at all levels, but the focus
is mainly on graduate and undergraduate students, as well as early and
mid-career researchers.

In this blog post, we summarise the EMNLP 2020 Diversity & Inclusion
(D&I) efforts to make sure that every attendee feels welcome and can get
the best out of their EMNLP 2020 conference attendance.

### Promoting Inclusion

EMNLP 2020 strives to remove all kinds of barriers that may limit
attendees\' conference experience. Specifically, we have organized four
types of events to promote both academic and socio-cultural inclusion:

-   ***Birds of a Feather (BoF) Sessions:*** In order to promote
    academic inclusion, we will coordinate Birds of a Feather (BoF)
    sessions to offer participants the opportunity to discuss research
    in specific areas with each other. BoF meetings aim to serve as an
    avenue for exchanging ideas and staying updated on one's research
    area, as well as for identifying new collaborations. We are
    organizing meetings for different research tracks, ensuring sessions
    across time zones, and estimate that there will be 30-50 attendees
    per track. You won't need to pre-register for BoF meetings; rather,
    you only need to follow the instructions which will be made
    available in the virtual conference portal.

-   ***Undergraduate Student Panel:*** We have organized a panel (with
    two sessions, to account for people in different time zones)
    designed for undergraduates attending the conference. We assume that
    these participants may be interested in pursuing a graduate degree,
    so we will provide presentations and informal small group
    conversations that will give people an idea how graduate study works
    and what research life is like.

-   ***Group Mentoring Sessions:*** We have organized a large number of
    group mentoring sessions spanning different time zones to offer
    students and early-career researchers a chance to meet and get
    advice from senior researchers on various topics. The sessions will
    be structured as roundtable discussions and deliberately kept small
    with at most 10 members in each group to maximize interaction.

-   ***Affinity Group Socials:*** Affinity group socials are formed
    around a "non-research-focused" interest, to raise awareness of
    socio-cultural differences and to share varied experiences. Hence,
    affinity group socials play an integral role in our efforts to
    promote socio-cultural inclusion. We have reached out to the
    affinity groups and will help them organize their own social events
    during the main conference. Affinity group socials at EMNLP 2020
    include: [Queer in
    AI](https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/emnlp2020),
    [Veg\*NLP](https://sites.google.com/view/vegnlp/), [LatinX in
    NLP](http://www.latinxinai.org/emnlp-2020), Building NLP in Africa,
    [North Africans in
    NLP](https://sites.google.com/view/NorthAfricansInNLP), Junior
    Faculty in Linguistics/CogSci and [The Unofficial EMNLP Welcome
    Social, Now with
    Clustering](https://nyu-mll.github.io/emnlp2020social/).

###  Increasing Financial Accessibility

A lot has changed with the shift to a virtual format, and expenses are
no exception. With the online format, large expenses like travel and
accommodation disappeared; this enables us to cover the conference
registration fees for more participants. On the other hand, the virtual
format has its own unique needs, where a stable internet connection is
the primary need. Therefore, to ensure that everyone can effectively
participate in the conference, we offer internet bandwidth subsidies for
participants who may find it expensive to obtain adequate internet
bandwidth. Additionally, we also recognize that childcare support can be
essential for some participants even in the virtual format; therefore,
we offer childcare subsidy as a replacement to the originally conceived
onsite childcare activities.

Applications to EMNLP 2020 D&I subsidy were received through [a
form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=kX-So6HNlkaviYyfHO_6kc6sgtkevo5FlcuZ17FkylVUMlZDM0JHWVoxRFRBT0RZUERRRjAzSUNURC4u)
which went live on 30 September 2020. To increase visibility, the form
was linked to the conference registration form, promoted on the EMNLP
website and shared on social media .

### Increasing Accessibility

-   **Writing Support**: In addition to the financial accessibility,
    Grammarly generously donated access codes for a one-month free use
    of its services to assist authors of accepted papers with their
    final revisions. We distributed these codes to the corresponding
    author of each accepted paper (including Findings papers). In total,
    1214 Grammarly access codes (754 Main conference, 460 Findings) were
    distributed after acceptance notifications.

-   **Video Captioning**: In the virtual setting, providing accurate
    captions to the video talks can make the conference accessible not
    only for attendees who are hearing-impaired or non-native English
    speakers, but virtually for everyone, as the sound quality of
    recordings can be affected by factors such as bad microphones or
    background noise. Automatic captioning alone, unfortunately, has
    been found to be insufficient to ensure high quality captions (as
    was found at ACL 2020). Therefore, we took care to ensure the
    authors knew about these problems and set strict deadlines (\~2
    weeks before the conference) for uploading presentation videos so
    that everyone will have enough time to edit their own automated
    captions to maximize the quality. Furthermore, we have recruited
    \"caption editors\" who are volunteers available to help authors to
    correct their captions.
