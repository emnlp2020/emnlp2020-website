    Here we announce the award winning papers for EMNLP, including honorable mentions and best demonstration paper. 
---

The Best Paper Awards recognise many of the outstanding papers appearing at
EMNLP 2020. We considered for these awards both long and short papers, as well
as demonstration papers.

The main paper awards were selected as follows:
 - Based on paper reviews, the opinions of the area chair, and the senior area
   chair(s), we constructed a short-list of strong papers. We ensured
   that the short-list contained papers of a diversity of different types:
   e.g., resources papers, theory papers, papers from most of the conference tracks, 
   and short and long format papers.
 - The short-listed papers were sent to a [Best Paper committee](https://2020.emnlp.org/organizers/best-paper-committee) 
   for further review, from which the overall top papers were awarded honourable mentions
   and best paper.
    
Note that the best demonstration paper was decided differently, being chosen directly by the Demonstration chairs.

The following papers have been given awards.
