  title: "Answers to your submission FAQs"
  description: >- 
    Here we answer a whole lot of questions about the details of the submission process, including what you can do with preprints.
---

#### Q1: Can we submit a survey-like paper to EMNLP 2020?
You are welcomed to submit a survey paper to EMNLP, provided that the survey makes a meaningful contribution to the research literature (such as new conclusions to draw, gaps in the current research, potential future research directions, etc.)

#### Q2: Can we submit a paper based on work reported previously in a talk?
A2: You are most welcome to submit your work to EMNLP2020 so long as the talk or the previous venue you submitted work to does not have a formal proceedings, with an ISBN/ISSN/DOI or similar. 

#### Q3: Does the anonymity deadline of May 01, 2020 refer to the submission deadline or publication deadline for an arXiv submission?
A3: For arXiv submissions, May 01 11:59pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth) is the submission deadline. For other non-anonymized versions, it is the deadline when such a version becomes public.

#### Q4: Can we submit EMNLP papers to EMNLP workshops?
A4: Given that we have recently changed the paper submission deadline and notification date due to Covid-19, we are making an exception to allow double submissions to both EMNLP and its workshops. This change has been reflected in the CFP.  

#### Q5: Can we submit EMNLP papers to a non-archival workshop? The workshop will not have formal published proceedings, but will provide links to accepted papers.
A5: If your workshop paper is published online between 1st May and 14th September, then you would violate our anonymity policy. 

#### Q6: We will post an arXiv preprint prior to the anonymity period, and we will not update / advertise it after anonymity begins.  May we introduce upgrades to the associated web demo and the related GitHub repo during the anonymity period if we do not announce these upgrades in any way?
A6: So long as you don't update your arXiv preprint during the anonymity period, you won't be considered as violating the anonymity policy. That is, you can still update your web demo and a GitHub repo after anonymity begins.

#### Q7: Can we append one page of appendix at the end of our full paper?
A7: There's a field on the submission form for your appendix, please submit it this way. The reviewers can still see this, it's just presented in a separate link to the paper itself. They are not required to read this, but if you refer to it from the paper then they are likely to look for this file.

#### Q8: We will introduce a new dataset in our EMNLP submission. We will include in the paper a URL linking to our dataset. Can we only upload a subset of our data?
A8: You may want to upload your dataset as a .zip archive, rather than a link. This will remain private between the reviewers & the relevant chairs, but not the wider world. It is our policy that reviewers must not steal data or ideas that they learn through the review process. If you feel nervous, then just upload a small sample, which is sufficient for reviewers to understand the resource.


#### Q9: If I have a link in my paper to a repository containing the code to reproduce the experiments, am I allowed to commit updates to this repository during the anonymity period?
A9: We advise you to submit your source code as a zip file to softconf instead of including a link to your repository in your paper.
