## Location

EMNLP 2020 is currently officially scheduled to be held in Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic. If the conference is held there physically, there are non-stop flights from many European and US cities, and favourable visa arrangements for many people, as well as presenting an attractive location for travel before or after, with or without family members.

### COVID-19 Update, 30th March 2020 

In view of the COVID-19 situation, there is a good chance that EMNLP2020 may be run purely online instead, to avoid international travel and risks of further contagion. If it is, we will ensure there is as much virtual social interaction as possible. 

## Venue

The physical conference venue which we may use is the Barceló Bávaro Convention Centre in the Dominican Republic.
The resort boasts amazing views, and sits alongside one of the 10 best beaches in the world. It offers attractive inclusive packages which include a great variety of food and drinks and as well as usage of the resort facilities.
